This form is only meant for submitting some data to the ProgrammaticSecureServlet using the HTTP POST method.
Remember that we have allowed all employees to access the doPost() of this servlet. Therefore, when you submit the form
you will be asked for username/password. And it will work only as per the users specified in tomcat-users.xml (explained in the previous page).
<br>Once you enter a valid username/password (john/jjj or bob/bbb), you'll not be asked for authentication again,  even if you try and log in with a different user name.
To change your authentication parameters, you'll have to shutdown all browser windows and access this page again.
